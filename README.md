# MARS-TASK-2
THROUGHT PROCESS
1. BASICALLY FIRST OF ALL I READ THE DOCUMENTARY OF THE MOTOR DRIVER (MD10C R3)
2. AND THEN I WRITE A BASIC CODE TO RUN MOTOR IN CLOCKWISE DIRECTION
3. AND THEN I CHECK WHEATHER MY CODE IS WORKING OR NOT
4. AFTER THAT I FIGURE OUT HOW THE ULTRASONIC SENSOR IS WROKING
5. AND I GOT TO KNOW THAT IT HAS VCC,TRIG ,ECHO ,GND PIN
6. the trigger (trig) pin is an input pin that initiates a measurement by sending out a sound wave. The echo pin is an output pin that produces a pulse when it receives a reflected signal
7. AND THEN I WRITE A CODE FOR ULTRASONIC SENSOR TO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE IN (CM)
8. Ultrasonic sensors calculate distance by measuring the time it takes for an ultrasonic sound wave to return after being emitted from the sensor head and reflecting off an object. The sensor determines the distance to the target using the speed of sound. The distance between the sensor and the object is calculated using the formula d = (v * t)/2.
9. AND THEN I WRITE A FINAL CODE BY COMBINING BOTH THIS CODE BY USING IF ELSE CONDITION TO COMPLETE THE GIVEN TASK
10. AND THEN FINALLY IT WORKS

APPLICATION :
1.AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM 
2.TO CALCULATE THE DEPT OF THE SEA 
3.ALTITUDE MEASUREMENT 
4.Anti-collision safety systems
5.Automated obstacle detection systems
6.Parking technologies
